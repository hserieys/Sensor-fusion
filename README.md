This README file is here to explain how to access to the different code of the sensor fusion project.

The path to access to the different code is : CalibrationStep/LeptonModule-master/software/raspberrypi_capture

Then you would have different codes used for my sensor project such as for Calibration, detection, Segmentation and identification.

There would be also many json files including data that I collected during my experiments. To process and analyze those data I created code such as: dispersion, dispersion_moving or robustness_analysis_smooth.

Finally, there would be also video or gifs that I used to illustrate my sensor fusion project.
